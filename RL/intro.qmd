<span style="font-size: 1.5em">Shortest Path</span><br/>

Finding the shortest path:

Where we have a graph $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ are the vertices and $E$ are the edges with weights $w$. The vertices are the $\textbf{states}$ and the edges are the $\textbf{actions}$. Tne goal is you have a starting state and you wanna reach the end state while attating the least cost of the wieghts $w$ along the edges.
If the startegy is $\textbf{Greedy}$ then it is suboptimal due to dealyed affects of long term decisions. There must be a better way to long-term planning.

Based on actions taken by the agent
