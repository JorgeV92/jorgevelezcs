All notes are based on the course at UIUC CS 443 taught by professor <a href="https://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/" style= "text-decoration: none;"> Nan Jiang (姜楠)</a>.

### <a href="mdp.qmd#mdp" class="hover-link">Markov Decision Process</a>

<span class="meta">Nov 22, 2023</span></br>
In this section, we will discuss how to formulate reinforcement learning problems using Markov decision processes (MDPs) and describe various components of MDPs in detail.

### Value Function

<span class="meta">Nov 22, 2023</span></br>
In this section we will discuss how to pick the best action for the robot at each state to maximize the return of the trajectory. We will describe an algorithm called Value Iteration and implement it for a simulated robot that travels over a frozen lake.
