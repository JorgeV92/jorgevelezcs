<a href="lab1a.qmd#lab1a" style="text-decoration: none;">P vs NP computational complexity in the heavens</a><br/>
The P vs NP problem, often regarded as the most significant unresolved issue in theoretical computer science, is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems identified by the Clay Mathematics Institute, offering a reward of one million dollars for a conclusive proof or disproof. In simple terms, 'P' represents a category of problems that are comparatively easy to solve, whereas 'NP' encompasses problems that are, on the surface, extremely challenging. If P were equal to NP, it would suggest that these seemingly difficult problems actually have straightforward solutions. However, the intricacies of this concept are more complex.
