All notes are based on the course at UIUC CS 443 taught by professor <a href="https://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/" style= "text-decoration: none;"> Nan Jiang (姜楠)</a>.

 As a senior Computer Science student embarking on the CS 443 course on Reinforcement Learning, I am filled with a sense of purpose and enthusiasm. This course, guided by Professor Nam Jiang, represents not just a pivotal point in my academic journey but also an opportunity to create a valuable resource for future students who will navigate the complexities of this advanced field. My decision to take this course in the upcoming semester is driven by a fascination with the dynamic and impactful world of RL. I understand the challenges that lie ahead, having encountered rigorous coursework in my academic path, but my commitment to delving deeper into Reinforcement Learning is unwavering. I am motivated not only by my desire to expand my own understanding but also by the prospect of aiding others in comprehending and appreciating the intricacies of this cutting-edge area of computer science.
